Join the \"singer\" table (aliased as T1) with the \"song\" table (aliased as T2) on the condition that the Singer_ID in both tables matches. Then, group the results by the name of the singer.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n1. SELECT T1.Name, sum(T2.Sales): This part of the statement selects the Name column from the T1 table (singer) and calculates the sum of the Sales column from the T2 table (song).\\n\\n2. FROM singer AS T1 JOIN song AS T2 ON T1.Singer_ID = T2.Singer_ID: This part specifies the tables involved in the query and how they are related. It joins the singer table (aliased as T1) with the song table (aliased as T2) based on the condition that the Singer_ID in both tables is equal.\\n\\n3. GROUP BY T1.Name: This part groups the results based on the Name column from the T1 table (singer), so that the total sales are calculated for each singer.\\n\\nOverall, this SQL statement retrieves the names of singers along with the total sales of their songs, by joining the singer and song tables on matching Singer_IDs and grouping the results by singer name.'"
