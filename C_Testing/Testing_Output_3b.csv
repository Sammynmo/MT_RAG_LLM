Explanation:
1. SELECT T2.name, T2.capacity: This part of the statement selects the name and capacity columns from the stadium table (aliased as T2).
2. FROM concert AS T1: Specifies the table concert and aliases it as T1.
3. JOIN stadium AS T2 ON T1.stadium_id = T2.stadium_id: Joins the concert table with the stadium table based on the stadium_id column to match concerts with their respective stadiums.
4. WHERE T1.year >= 2014: Filters the concerts to only include those that took place in the year 2014 or later.
5. GROUP BY T2.stadium_id: Groups the results by stadium_id from the stadium table to count the number of concerts per stadium.
6. ORDER BY count(*) DESC: Orders the results by the count of concerts per stadium in descending order.
7. LIMIT 1: Limits the output to only display the stadium with the highest count of concerts.

Example using context:
Considering the schema provided:
- concert table has columns: concert_id, stadium_id, year

Explanation: 
1. SELECT T1.CountryName: We want to select the column ""CountryName"" from the table ""COUNTRIES"" and alias it as ""T1"".
2. FROM COUNTRIES AS T1: We are selecting data from the table ""COUNTRIES"" and aliasing it as ""T1"".

car_1,"SELECT T2.MakeId ,  T2.Make FROM CARS_DATA AS T1 JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T2 ON T1.Id  =  T2.MakeId WHERE T1.Horsepower  >  (SELECT min(Horsepower) FROM CARS_DATA) AND T1.Cylinders  <=  3;","Among the cars with more than lowest horsepower, which ones do not have more than 3 cylinders? List the car makeid and make name.","Translation: Show the make ID and make of cars where the horsepower is greater than the minimum horsepower in the CARS_DATA table and the number of cylinders is less than or equal to 3.

Explanation:
1. The SQL statement starts with the SELECT keyword to indicate that we want to retrieve data from the database.
2. We are selecting two columns, MakeId and Make, from two different tables, CARS_DATA and CAR_NAMES.
3. We are giving an alias ""T1"" to the CARS_DATA table and an alias ""T2"" to the CAR_NAMES table.
4. We are using the JOIN keyword to combine the two tables based on the condition T1.Id = T2.MakeId. This means that we are joining the tables on the Id column of CARS_DATA and the MakeId column of CAR_NAMES.
5. The WHERE clause is used to filter the results. We are specifying two conditions:
   a. T1.Horsepower > (SELECT min(Horsepower) FROM CARS_DATA): This subquery calculates the minimum horsepower from the CARS_DATA table, and we are comparing it with the Horsepower column of T1 (CARS_DATA table).
   b. T1.Cylinders <= 3: This condition checks if the value in the Cylinders column of T1 (CARS_DATA table) is less than or equal to 3.
6. The result will show the MakeId and Make of cars that meet the specified criteria.

Example:
- Suppose the CARS_DATA table has columns: Id, Horsepower, Cylinders.
- Suppose the CAR_NAMES table has columns: MakeId, Make.
- If CARS_DATA has a row with Id = 1, Horsepower = 200, and Cylinders = 4, and CAR_NAMES has a row with MakeId = 1 and Make = ""Toyota"", this row will not be included in the result because the number of cylinders is greater than 3.",Translation: Show the make ID and make of cars where the horsepower is greater than the minimum horsepower in the CARS_DATA table and the number of cylinders is less than or equal to 3.,"1. The SQL statement starts with the SELECT keyword to indicate that we want to retrieve data from the database.
2. We are selecting two columns, MakeId and Make, from two different tables, CARS_DATA and CAR_NAMES.

Explanation:
1. The SQL statement starts by selecting the id and maker columns from the car_makers table and assigns the alias ""t1"" to this table.
2. It then joins the model_list table, assigning the alias ""t2"" to it, on the condition that the id from car_makers is equal to the maker in model_list.
3. The result is then grouped by the id from car_makers.
4. The HAVING clause filters the grouped results to only include those where the count of entries for each id is greater than or equal to 2.
5. The INTERSECT keyword is used to combine the results of this query with another query.
6. The second part of the query is similar to the first, but it adds another join with the car_names table, assigning the alias ""t3"" to it, on the condition that the model from model_list is equal to the model in car_names.
7. This part is also grouped by the id from car_makers.
8. The HAVING clause in the second part further filters the results to only include those where the count of entries for each id is greater than 3.

flight_2,SELECT AirportName FROM Airports WHERE AirportCode NOT IN (SELECT SourceAirport FROM Flights UNION SELECT DestAirport FROM Flights),Find the name of airports which do not have any flight in and out.,"Translation: Show the names of airports that are not listed as either source or destination airports in the Flights table.

Explanation: 
1. SELECT AirportName: We want to retrieve the AirportName column from the Airports table.
2. FROM Airports: We are selecting data from the Airports table.
3. WHERE AirportCode NOT IN: This filters the records in the Airports table where the AirportCode is not found in the result set of the subquery.
4. (SELECT SourceAirport FROM Flights UNION SELECT DestAirport FROM Flights): This subquery retrieves a list of all unique airport codes that appear as either the source or destination airport in the Flights table.
5. So, the overall query will return the names of airports that are not in the list of source or destination airports in the Flights table.

Example:
- Airports table: AirportCode, AirportName
- Flights table: FlightID, SourceAirport, DestAirport

If the Airports table contains:
AirportCode | AirportName
JFK | John F. Kennedy International Airport
LAX | Los Angeles International Airport
ORD | O'Hare International Airport

And the Flights table contains:
FlightID | SourceAirport | DestAirport
1 | JFK | LAX
2 | LAX | ORD

The query will return:

Explanation: This SQL statement is asking for the names of shops from the ""shop"" table where the ""number_products"" column is greater than the average number of products in all shops. This is achieved by using a subquery to calculate the average number of products in all shops and then comparing it to the number of products in each shop.

employee_hire_evaluation,SELECT district FROM shop WHERE Number_products  <  3000 INTERSECT SELECT district FROM shop WHERE Number_products  >  10000,Which district has both stores with less than 3000 products and stores with more than 10000 products?,"Translation: Show the districts of shops where the number of products is less than 3000 and also greater than 10000.

Explanation: 
1. The SQL statement starts with SELECT district, which means we want to retrieve the district information from the shop table.
2. The statement then uses the INTERSECT keyword to combine the results of two separate SELECT statements.
3. The first SELECT statement is SELECT district FROM shop WHERE Number_products < 3000, which retrieves the districts of shops where the number of products is less than 3000.
4. The second SELECT statement is SELECT district FROM shop WHERE Number_products > 10000, which retrieves the districts of shops where the number of products is greater than 10000.
5. The INTERSECT operator will return only the districts that appear in both result sets, satisfying both conditions of having less than 3000 products and more than 10000 products.

Example:
- Suppose we have a shop table with the following data:
| shop_id | district | Number_products |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| 1       | A        | 2000            |
| 2       | B        | 5000            |
| 3       | C        | 12000           |

In this example, the SQL statement would return the district ""C"" because it is the only district that satisfies both conditions (Number_products < 3000 and Number_products > 10000).",Translation: Show the districts of shops where the number of products is less than 3000 and also greater than 10000.,"1.

cre_Doc_Template_Mgt,"SELECT document_name ,  template_id FROM Documents WHERE Document_Description LIKE ""%w%""",What is the document name and template id for document with description with the letter 'w' in it?,"Translation: Show the document name and template ID for documents where the document description contains the letter ""w"".

Explanation: This SQL statement is requesting data from the ""Documents"" table. It is specifically asking for the ""document_name"" and ""template_id"" columns. The condition specified in the WHERE clause is looking for rows where the ""Document_Description"" column contains the letter ""w"". The ""%"" symbol is a wildcard that means any characters can appear before or after the letter ""w"". 

For example, if we have the following data in the ""Documents"" table:

| document_name | template_id | Document_Description |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Document1     | 1           | This is a test       |
| Document2     | 2           | Report with charts   |
| Document3     | 3           | Weekly update        |

The SQL statement would return:

| document_name | template_id |
|---------------|-------------|
| Document2     | 2           |
| Document3     | 3           |

This is because only ""Document2"" and ""Document3"" have a document description that contains the letter ""w"".","Translation: Show the document name and template ID for documents where the document description contains the letter ""w"".","This SQL statement is requesting data from the ""Documents"" table.

course_teach,SELECT Name FROM teacher WHERE Teacher_id NOT IN (SELECT Teacher_id FROM course_arrange),List the names of teachers who have not been arranged to teach courses.,"Translation: Retrieve the names of teachers who do not have any courses arranged.

Explanation: This SQL statement is asking to select the ""Name"" column from the ""teacher"" table where the ""Teacher_id"" is not found in the list of ""Teacher_id"" values from the ""course_arrange"" table. This means we want to find teachers who do not have any entries in the ""course_arrange"" table, indicating they do not have any courses scheduled.

Example using the context:

museum_visit,SELECT name FROM museum WHERE num_of_staff  >  (SELECT min(num_of_staff) FROM museum WHERE open_year  >  2010),find the names of museums which have more staff than the minimum staff number of all museums opened after 2010.,"Translation: Retrieve the names of museums where the number of staff is greater than the minimum number of staff among museums that were opened after the year 2010.

Explanation: 
1. First, we need to find the minimum number of staff among museums that were opened after the year 2010. This is done by the inner query: 
   ```sql
   SELECT min(num_of_staff) FROM museum WHERE open_year > 2010
   ```
   This query will give us the minimum number of staff among museums that opened after 2010.

2. The outer query then selects the names of museums where the number of staff is greater than the result of the inner query:
   ```sql
   SELECT name FROM museum WHERE num_of_staff > (SELECT min(num_of_staff) FROM museum WHERE open_year > 2010)
   ```
   This query will retrieve the names of museums that have a number of staff greater than the minimum number of staff among museums that opened after 2010.

For example, given the following data in the museum table:
| name           | num_of_staff | open_year |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Museum A       | 50           | 2012      |

| Museum D       | 40           | 2018      |

The inner query will calculate the minimum number of staff among museums opened after 2010, which is 30 (from Museum B). The outer query will then return the names of museums with a number of staff greater than 30, which would be Museum A and Museum D.",Translation: Retrieve the names of museums where the number of staff is greater than the minimum number of staff among museums that were opened after the year 2010.,"1.

Explanation:
1. SELECT T1.treatment_type_description: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the treatment_type_description from the Treatment_types table, which is aliased as T1.

2. FROM Treatment_types AS T1: This specifies the table from which we are retrieving the treatment type description, and aliases the table as T1 for easier reference in the query.

3. JOIN Treatments AS T2 ON T1.treatment_type_code = T2.treatment_type_code: This is a JOIN statement that links the Treatment_types table with the Treatments table based on the treatment_type_code column, to ensure that we are only retrieving information that matches between the two tables.

4. GROUP BY T1.treatment_type_code: This part of the query groups the results by the treatment type code from the Treatment_types table, ensuring that each unique treatment type is represented only once in the output.

5. ORDER BY sum(cost_of_treatment) ASC: The results are then ordered in ascending order based on the sum of the cost_of_treatment column from the Treatments table. This means that the treatment types will be sorted from the cheapest total cost of treatment to the most expensive.

6. LIMIT 1: Finally, the LIMIT 1 clause ensures that only the first result (the treatment type with the lowest total cost of treatment) is returned in the output.

Example using the schema:
- Treatment_types table: 
  - Columns: treatment_type_code, treatment_type_description

- Treatments table:
  - Columns: treatment_type_code, cost_of_treatment

If we have the following data in the Treatments table:
| treatment_type_code | cost_of_treatment |

| 3                   | 80                |

After executing the query, it will calculate the total cost of treatment for each treatment type:
- Treatment type 1: 100 + 120 = 220
- Treatment type 2: 150
- Treatment type 3: 80

It will then order the results in ascending order based on the total cost of treatment:
1. Treatment type 3: 80
2. Treatment type 2: 150
3. Treatment type 1: 220

Since we have specified LIMIT 1, the output will only show the treatment type with the lowest total cost, which in this case is treatment type 3 with a total cost of 80.","Translation: Retrieve the description of the treatment type from the Treatment_types table where the treatment type code matches between Treatment_types and Treatments tables. Group the results by treatment type code, then order them in ascending order based on the sum of the cost of treatment, and limit the output to the first result.","1. SELECT T1.treatment_type_description: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the treatment_type_description from the Treatment_types table, which is aliased as T1.

2. FROM Treatment_types AS T1: This specifies the table from which we are retrieving the treatment type description, and aliases the table as T1 for easier reference in the query.

3. JOIN Treatments AS T2 ON T1.treatment_type_code = T2.treatment_type_code: This is a JOIN statement that links the Treatment_types table with the Treatments table based on the treatment_type_code column, to ensure that we are only retrieving information that matches between the two tables.

4. GROUP BY T1.treatment_type_code: This part of the query groups the results by the treatment type code from the Treatment_types table, ensuring that each unique treatment type is represented only once in the output.

5. ORDER BY sum(cost_of_treatment) ASC: The results are then ordered in ascending order based on the sum of the cost_of_treatment column from the Treatments table. This means that the treatment types will be sorted from the cheapest total cost of treatment to the most expensive.

6. LIMIT 1: Finally, the LIMIT 1 clause ensures that only the first result (the treatment type with the lowest total cost of treatment) is returned in the output.

Example using the schema:
- Treatment_types table: 
  - Columns: treatment_type_code, treatment_type_description

- Treatments table:
  - Columns: treatment_type_code, cost_of_treatment

If we have the following data in the Treatments table:
| treatment_type_code | cost_of_treatment |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1                   | 100               |
| 2                   | 150               |
| 1                   | 120               |
| 3                   | 80                |

After executing the query, it will calculate the total cost of treatment for each treatment type:
- Treatment type 1: 100 + 120 = 220
- Treatment type 2: 150
- Treatment type 3: 80

It will then order the results in ascending order based on the total cost of treatment:
1. Treatment type 3: 80
2. Treatment type 2: 150
3. Treatment type 1: 220

Since we have specified LIMIT 1, the output will only show the treatment type with the lowest total cost, which in this case is treatment type 3 with a total cost of 80."

Show the owner id and zip code.,"Translation: Show the owner_id and zip_code of the owner who has spent the most on treatments for their dog.

Explanation: 
1. SELECT T1.owner_id, T1.zip_code: This part of the statement selects the owner_id and zip_code from the Owners table, aliasing it as T1.
2. FROM Owners AS T1: This specifies that we are selecting data from the Owners table and aliasing it as T1.
3. JOIN Dogs AS T2 ON T1.owner_id = T2.owner_id: This joins the Owners table with the Dogs table on the owner_id column, linking the two tables together.
4. JOIN Treatments AS T3 ON T2.dog_id = T3.dog_id: This joins the Dogs table with the Treatments table on the dog_id column, linking all three tables together.
5. GROUP BY T1.owner_id: This groups the results by owner_id, so that we can calculate the total cost of treatments for each owner.
6. ORDER BY sum(T3.cost_of_treatment) DESC: This orders the results by the sum of the cost_of_treatment column from the Treatments table in descending order, so that the owner who has spent the most on treatments will be at the top.

Explanation:
1. Start by looking at the Dogs table and Treatments table. The Dogs table has columns such as dog_id, name, and breed_code. The Treatments table has columns like dog_id and date_of_treatment.

2. The SQL statement begins with the SELECT keyword, indicating that we want to retrieve specific columns from the tables.

3. T1 and T2 are aliases for the Dogs and Treatments tables, respectively.

4. The JOIN keyword is used to combine rows from both tables based on a related column, in this case, dog_id.

5. The ON keyword specifies the condition for the join, where T1.dog_id must be equal to T2.dog_id.

6. The WHERE clause filters the results based on a condition. Here, we are filtering for dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences.

7. The subquery (SELECT breed_code FROM Dogs GROUP BY breed_code ORDER BY count(*) ASC LIMIT 1) is used to find the breed_code with the least count of occurrences in the Dogs table.

8. The outer query then retrieves the name of the dog and the date of treatment for dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences.

Example:
- If the Dogs table contains the following data:
| dog_id | name  | breed_code |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 1      | Max   | A          |
| 2      | Bella | B          |
