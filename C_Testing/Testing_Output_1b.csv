The SQL statement starts by selecting the columns ""owner_id"" and ""zip_code"" from the table ""Owners"" as T1.
2. It then joins this table with the table ""Dogs"" as T2 on the condition that the ""owner_id"" in T1 matches the ""owner_id"" in T2.
3. Next, it joins the result of the previous join with the table ""Treatments"" as T3 on the condition that the ""dog_id"" in T2 matches the ""dog_id"" in T3.

dog_kennels,"SELECT T1.name ,  T2.date_of_treatment FROM Dogs AS T1 JOIN Treatments AS T2 ON T1.dog_id  =  T2.dog_id WHERE T1.breed_code  =  ( SELECT breed_code FROM Dogs GROUP BY breed_code ORDER BY count(*) ASC LIMIT 1 )",List the names of the dogs of the rarest breed and the treatment dates of them.,"Translation: List the name of the dog and the date of treatment for dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences.

Explanation: 
1. We need to select the name of the dog (T1.name) and the date of treatment (T2.date_of_treatment) from the tables Dogs (as T1) and Treatments (as T2).
2. We are joining the Dogs table with the Treatments table on the condition that the dog_id in Dogs matches the dog_id in Treatments (T1.dog_id = T2.dog_id).
3. We want to filter the results to only include dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences. To find this breed, we need to compare the breed_code in the Dogs table with the breed_code that has the least occurrences. This is done by using a subquery: (SELECT breed_code FROM Dogs GROUP BY breed_code ORDER BY count(*) ASC LIMIT 1).
4. The subquery will give us the breed_code with the least number of occurrences, and we will use this value to filter the results in the main query.

Example: If the breed_code 'Labrador' has the least number of occurrences among all dog breeds in the Dogs table, the query will return the names of Labradors and their treatment dates.",Translation: List the name of the dog and the date of treatment for dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences.,"1.

Explanation: 
1. SELECT T1.Name: This part of the query selects the Name column from the singer table, which is aliased as T1.
2. sum(T2.Sales): This part calculates the total sales by summing up the Sales column from the song table, aliased as T2.
3. FROM singer AS T1: Specifies the singer table and aliases it as T1 for the query.

Explanation: This SQL statement is selecting the property names from the table Properties where the property_type_code is ""House"" and also where the property_type_code is ""Apartment"" and the room_count is greater than 1. The UNION operator is used to combine the results of the two SELECT statements into a single result set.
