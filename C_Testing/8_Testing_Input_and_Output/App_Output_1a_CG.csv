The query aims to retrieve the MakeId and Make of cars with horsepower greater than the minimum horsepower and cylinders less than or equal to 3.

**Explanation:**

The query consists of a SELECT clause that specifies the columns to be retrieved (MakeId and Make). It joins the CARS_DATA and CAR_NAMES tables based on the MakeId column. The WHERE clause filters the results based on two conditions:

- Horsepower greater than the minimum horsepower (calculated using a subquery).

List the id and the maker .,"**Translation:**

The query aims to identify car makers with at least two distinct models and at least three distinct car names associated with those models.

**Explanation:**

The query utilizes two `SELECT` statements with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses to filter car makers based on the number of models and car names.

The first `SELECT` statement joins the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables on the `maker` column and groups the results by `t1.id`. It then applies a `HAVING` clause to filter car makers with at least two distinct models (using `count(*) >= 2`).

The second `SELECT` statement further joins the `car_names` table on the `model` column and groups the results by `t1.id`. It then applies another `HAVING` clause to filter car makers with at least three distinct car names (using `count(*) > 3`).

The `INTERSECT` operator combines the results of both `SELECT` statements, resulting in car makers that satisfy both conditions.

**Example:**

In the context provided, the query would identify car makers with the following characteristics:

- **At least two distinct models:** The `model_list` table shows that the car maker with `id` 1 has two distinct models (e.g., ""model_a"" and ""model_b"").
- **At least three distinct car names:** The `car_names` table shows that the car maker with `id` 1 also has three distinct car names (e.g., ""car_a"", ""car_b"", and ""car_c"").

Therefore, the query would return the car maker with `id` 1 and its corresponding `maker` value.","**Translation:**

Explanation:
The query utilizes two subqueries to achieve this goal. The first subquery retrieves car makers with two or more distinct models by grouping by the `maker` column and filtering for groups with a count greater than or equal to two. The second subquery retrieves car makers with three or more distinct car names associated with their models by joining with the `CAR_NAMES` table, grouping by the `maker` column, and filtering for groups with a count greater than or equal to three.

The query aims to identify the distinct semester IDs associated with students enrolled in both Master's and Bachelor's degree programs.

**Explanation:**

The query utilizes the INTERSECT operator to retrieve semester IDs from two separate subqueries. Each subquery joins the Degree_Programs and Student_Enrolment tables based on the degree program ID. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only students enrolled in Master's and Bachelor's programs, respectively. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that duplicate semester IDs are eliminated from the final result.

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Subquery 1:** Selects semester IDs from the Student_Enrolment table where the degree program name is 'Master'.
2. **Subquery 2:** Selects semester IDs from the Student_Enrolment table where the degree program name is 'Bachelor'.
3. **INTERSECT Operation:** Combines the results of both subqueries to obtain semester IDs that are common to both Master's and Bachelor's programs.

**Example:**

If the Student_Enrolment table contains the following data:

| Student_Enrolment_ID | Degree_Program_ID | Semester_ID |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |

- **JOIN:** This clause specifies how the tables will be joined together. In this case, it joins the `singer` and `song` tables using the `Singer_ID` column as the join condition.
- **GROUP BY:** This clause specifies the column(s) to be used for grouping the results. In this case, it groups the results by the `Name` column from the `singer` table.
- **SUM:** This function calculates the sum of the `Sales` column from the `song` table for each group.

The query works by first joining the `singer` and `song` tables on the `Singer_ID` column. This allows the query to access the `Sales` column from the `song` table for each singer. The query then groups the results by the `Name` column from the `singer` table. This groups the results by singer name. Finally, the query calculates the sum of the `Sales` column for each group. This gives the total sales for each singer."
real_estate_properties,"SELECT property_name FROM Properties WHERE property_type_code  =  ""House"" UNION SELECT property_name FROM Properties WHERE property_type_code  =  ""Apartment"" AND room_count  >  1",What are the names of properties that are either houses or apartments with more than 1 room?,"**Translation:**

The query aims to retrieve the property names of all houses and apartments with more than one room.

**Explanation:**

The query is composed of two SELECT statements, each with a different WHERE clause. The first SELECT statement retrieves the property names of all houses (where property_type_code = ""House""). The second SELECT statement retrieves the property names of all apartments (where property_type_code = ""Apartment"") with more than one room (where room_count > 1). The UNION operator combines the results of both SELECT statements, resulting in a list of all property names that meet the specified criteria.

The query utilizes the Properties table to retrieve the property names and property type codes. It also uses the REF_PROPERTY_TYPES table to map property type codes to property type descriptions. The query filters the results based on the property type code and room count, ensuring that only relevant properties are included in the final output.","**Translation:**
