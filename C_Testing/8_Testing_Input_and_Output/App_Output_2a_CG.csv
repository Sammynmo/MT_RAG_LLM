**Explanation:**

The query uses a subquery to identify airports that have been used as the source or destination airport in at least one flight. The main query then selects the names of airports that are not included in the subquery's result set.

The subquery uses the UNION operator to combine the results of two subqueries. The first subquery selects the source airports from the Flights table, while the second subquery selects the destination airports from the Flights table. The UNION operator combines these two sets of airports into a single result set.

The Query aims to identify the districts where shops have both a low number of products (less than 3000) and a high number of products (greater than 10000).

**Explanation:**

The Query is composed of two SELECT statements, each with a WHERE clause. The first SELECT statement retrieves the district names from the shop table where the Number_products column is less than 3000. The second SELECT statement retrieves the district names from the shop table where the Number_products column is greater than 10000. The INTERSECT keyword is used to combine the results of both SELECT statements, resulting in a list of districts that meet both conditions.

The Query works by filtering the shop table based on the number of products in each district. The first WHERE clause filters for districts with a low number of products, while the second WHERE clause filters for districts with a high number of products. The INTERSECT keyword ensures that the final result includes only districts that are present in both sets of results.

For example, if the shop table contains the following data:

The query aims to retrieve the distinct semester IDs from the Student_Enrolment table where the degree_summary_name in the Degree_Programs table is either 'Master' or 'Bachelor'.

**Explanation:**

The query is composed of two SELECT statements joined by an INTERSECT operator.

The first SELECT statement retrieves the semester IDs from the Student_Enrolment table where the degree_summary_name in the Degree_Programs table is 'Master'.

The second SELECT statement retrieves the semester IDs from the Student_Enrolment table where the degree_summary_name in the Degree_Programs table is 'Bachelor'.

The INTERSECT operator combines the results of both SELECT statements to return only the semester IDs that are common to both results.

For example, if the Student_Enrolment table contains the following data:

| semester_id | degree_program_id |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 3 |

And the Degree_Programs table contains the following data:

| degree_program_id | degree_summary_name |
|---|---|
| 1 | Master |
| 2 | Bachelor |
| 3 | PhD |

The query would return the following result:

| semester_id |
|---|---|
| 1 |

This is because the only semester ID that is common to both 'Master' and 'Bachelor' degree programs is 1.","**Translation:**
