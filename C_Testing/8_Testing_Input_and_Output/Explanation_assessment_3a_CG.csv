1. Overall structure:
The explanation correctly identifies that the query consists of two SELECT statements joined by an INTERSECT operator.

2. First SELECT statement:
- Correctly explains the tables involved (car_makers and model_list) and the join condition.
- Accurately describes the grouping by car maker ID.
- Correctly states the filtering condition (count >= 2).
- However, it incorrectly refers to ""count of distinct models"" when the query uses COUNT(*), which counts all rows, not distinct models.

3. Second SELECT statement:
- Correctly explains the tables involved (car_makers, model_list, and car_names) and the join conditions.
- Accurately describes the grouping by car maker ID.
- Correctly states the filtering condition (count > 3).
- Again, it incorrectly refers to ""count of distinct car names"" when the query uses COUNT(*).

4. INTERSECT operation:
The explanation correctly describes the purpose of the INTERSECT operator.

5. Alignment with the question:
The explanation doesn't directly address the question's wording about ""more than 3 car makers."" Instead, it interprets this as ""more than 3 car names,"" which is what the query actually does.

Assessment:
The explanation is mostly accurate and provides a good understanding of the query structure. However, there are two minor issues:
1. It incorrectly interprets COUNT(*) as counting distinct models/car names.
2. It doesn't address the discrepancy between the question's wording and the actual query implementation regarding ""more than 3 car makers.""

1. SELECT clause: The explanation is mostly correct, but it incorrectly states that the sum of the Total_spent column is selected. The SELECT clause only lists t2.visitor_id, t1.name, and t1.Level_of_membership.

2. FROM clause: This is correctly explained.

3. JOIN clause: This is correctly explained.

4. GROUP BY clause: This is correctly explained, although it could be clearer that grouping is necessary because of the aggregate function in the ORDER BY clause.

5. ORDER BY clause: This is correctly explained, though it doesn't mention that sum(t2.Total_spent) is not in the SELECT list.

6. LIMIT clause: This is correctly explained.

Overall, the explanation covers all parts of the query and provides a good general understanding. However, there are a couple of minor errors:

- It incorrectly states that the sum of Total_spent is in the SELECT clause.
- It doesn't highlight that the sum(t2.Total_spent) used in ORDER BY is not in the SELECT list, which is unusual but valid in SQL.

These errors don't significantly impact the overall understanding of the query's purpose and structure, but they do introduce some inaccuracies.

Based on this assessment, I would rate this explanation as:

Score: 3 (Minor errors)

The explanation is generally good and covers all parts of the query, but it contains a few minor inaccuracies that slightly reduce its quality."
