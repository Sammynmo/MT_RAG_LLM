**Translation:**

This query aims to retrieve the treatment type descriptions associated with the highest total cost of treatment for each treatment type code, sorted in ascending order based on the total cost of treatment.

**Explanation:**

The query is composed of several parts:

1. **SELECT T1.treatment_type_description:** This part specifies that the query should select the `treatment_type_description` column from the `Treatment_types` table (aliased as `T1`)
2. **FROM Treatment_types AS T1 JOIN Treatments AS T2 ON T1.treatment_type_code = T2.treatment_type_code:** This part defines the join between the `Treatment_types` and `Treatments` tables.

3. **GROUP BY T1.treatment_type_code:** This part groups the results based on the `treatment_type_code` column.
4. **ORDER BY sum(cost_of_treatment) ASC:** This part sorts the grouped results in ascending order based on the total cost of treatment calculated by summing the `cost_of_treatment` column values for each group.
5. **LIMIT 1:** This part limits the results to return only the first result, which will be the treatment type description associated with the highest total cost of treatment for the first treatment type code.","This query aims to retrieve the treatment type descriptions associated with the highest total cost of treatment for each treatment type code, sorted in ascending order based on the total cost of treatment.","The query is composed of several parts:
