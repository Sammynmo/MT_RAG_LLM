1. **SELECT T2.name, T2.capacity**: This part specifies that we want to retrieve the name and capacity of the stadium (from the `stadium` table, aliased as T2).

2. **FROM concert AS T1**: We are selecting data from the `concert` table, which is aliased as T1.

3. **JOIN stadium AS T2 ON T1.stadium_id = T2.stadium_id**: This line joins the `concert` table (T1) with the `stadium` table (T2) based on the `stadium_id`. This means we are linking concerts to the stadiums where they were held.

4. **WHERE T1.year >= 2014**: This condition filters the results to include only concerts that took place in the year 2014 or later.

5. **GROUP BY T2.stadium_id**: This groups the results by the `stadium_id`, allowing us to aggregate data for each stadium.

6. **ORDER BY count(*) DESC**: This orders the grouped results by the number of concerts held at each stadium in descending order, meaning the stadium with the most concerts will be at the top.

7. **LIMIT 1**: Finally, this limits the results to just one record, which will be the stadium that has hosted the most concerts since 2014.

**Explanation of the SQL Query:**

1. **SELECT T1.Name, sum(T2.Sales)**: This part specifies that we want to select the name of the singer (from the singer table, referred to as T1) and the total sales of their songs (from the song table, referred to as T2). The `sum(T2.Sales)` function calculates the total sales for each singer.

2. **FROM singer AS T1**: This indicates that we are pulling data from the `singer` table and giving it the alias T1 for easier reference.

3. **JOIN song AS T2 ON T1.Singer_ID = T2.Singer_ID**: This part joins the `song` table (aliased as T2) with the `singer` table (T1) based on the condition that the `Singer_ID` in the singer table matches the `Singer_ID` in the song table. This allows us to combine data from both tables where there is a relationship.

4. **GROUP BY T1.Name**: Finally, this clause groups the results by the singer's name. This means that for each unique singer name, the query will calculate the total sales of their songs.

In summary, the query retrieves each singer's name along with the total sales of all their songs by combining data from the singer and song tables based on their shared `Singer_ID`.","**Translation:**
Retrieve the names of singers and the total sales of their songs by joining the singer and song tables, grouping the results by singer name.
