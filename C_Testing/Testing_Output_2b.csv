Explanation:
1. The main goal is to retrieve the first name and age of students who own a dog and do not own a cat as a pet.
2. The query starts by selecting the columns ""fname"" and ""age"" from the ""student"" table, aliased as T1.
3. It then joins the ""student"" table with the ""has_pet"" table, aliased as T2, on the condition that the student ID (stuid) in both tables matches.
4. Another join is made with the ""pets"" table, aliased as T3, on the condition that the pet ID (petid) in the ""pets"" table matches the pet ID in the ""has_pet"" table.
5. A condition is added to filter only those students who own a pet of type 'dog' by checking the pettype column in the ""pets"" table.
6. To ensure that the student does not own a pet of type 'cat', a subquery is used. This subquery selects the student IDs of those who own a cat as a pet and then excludes those student IDs from the main query.

In this example, the total cost of treatment for ""Surgery"" is 1200 and for ""Medication"" is 700. Since we are ordering in ascending order, the treatment type with the lowest total cost is ""Medication"". The query should return ""Medication"" as the output."
dog_kennels,"SELECT T1.owner_id ,  T1.zip_code FROM Owners AS T1 JOIN Dogs AS T2 ON T1.owner_id  =  T2.owner_id JOIN Treatments AS T3 ON T2.dog_id  =  T3.dog_id GROUP BY T1.owner_id ORDER BY sum(T3.cost_of_treatment) DESC LIMIT 1",Which owner has paid the largest amount of money in total for their dogs? Show the owner id and zip code.,"Translation: Find the owner ID and zip code of the owner who has spent the most on treatments for their dogs.

Explanation:
1. The SQL statement starts by selecting the columns owner_id and zip_code from the Owners table (aliased as T1).
2. It then performs a join operation with the Dogs table (aliased as T2) on the owner_id column to match owners with their dogs.
3. Another join operation is done with the Treatments table (aliased as T3) on the dog_id column to link treatments to the respective dogs.
4. The data is then grouped by owner_id to group all treatments for each owner together.
5. The results are ordered in descending order by the sum of the cost_of_treatment column from the Treatments table, which represents the total amount spent on treatments for each owner.
6. Finally, the LIMIT 1 clause is used to only return the owner who has spent the most on treatments.",Translation: Find the owner ID and zip code of the owner who has spent the most on treatments for their dogs.,"1.

Explanation: This SQL statement retrieves the name of the dog and the date of treatment from the Dogs table (aliased as T1) and Treatments table (aliased as T2) respectively. It then joins these tables on the dog_id column. The WHERE clause filters the results to only include dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences, determined by the subquery that selects the breed_code from the Dogs table, groups them by breed_code, orders them by the count of occurrences in ascending order, and limits the result to 1.",Translation: List the name of the dog and the date of treatment for dogs that belong to the breed with the least number of occurrences.,"This SQL statement retrieves the name of the dog and the date of treatment from the Dogs table (aliased as T1) and Treatments table (aliased as T2) respectively.
